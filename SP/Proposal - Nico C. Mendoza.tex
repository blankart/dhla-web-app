\subsection{Background of the Study}

The Philippines recently implemented a comprehensive reform on its basic education known as the K-to-12 program \cite{Okabe}. The K-to-12 program encompasses kindergarten and 12 years of basic education - six years primary education, four years Junior High School and two years Senior High School \cite{Gazette}. With this program the Philippines is slowly matching the global standards in secondary education. The main objectives of the program are to better prepare students for higher education, to gain eligibility for domestic and overseas educational institutions, and to provide immediate employability upon graduating \cite{Okabe}.

With the new educational program, a new curriculum was introduced together with its subjects. The kindergarten curriculum framework applies the goals of the k-to-12 program and implements the general principles of the National Early Learning Framework. Students in grades 1 to 10 will encounter an improved, context-based, and spiral progression learning curriculum with several subjects. On the other hand, Senior High School (SHS) is two years of secondary education with specialization. A student will choose a career track - Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, and Sports and Arts. The chosen career track will define a student's subjects \cite{Okabe}.

A new program with new curriculum will also include a change in the grading system. The Department of Education (DepEd) provided teachers a free copy of Electronics Class Record (ECR) Templates \cite{depEd}. The templates provide for grade computation consistent with DepEd Order No. 8, s. 2015, referred to as the Policy Guidelines on Classroom Assessment for the K to 12 Basic Education Program. 

ECR templates are MS Excel based. It has three (3) components for grades: Written Work, Performance Tasks, and Quarterly Assessment. By downloading and comparing the different ECR templates, the templates differ at least each grade level. The ECR also changes when Senior High students are being handled. Some of the changes include following a different set of weights for each component compared to grades 1 to 10.

Class records are one of the most important things kept by teachers. This holds all the class performance of the students a teacher handles \cite{Dellosa}. At present creating an online or web-based class record system is possible. Teachers and school administrators are also updated with technology \cite{Dellosa}. They can use laptops, computers and even phones easily. Keeping class records or records, in general, is commonly done with the use of spreadsheet applications \cite{Dellosa}. Even though spreadsheets have proven to be a useful tool for keeping records, creating an application with better management capabilities is possible.

\subsection{Statement of the Problem}
Dee Hwa Liong Academy is an educational institution that implements the K-to-12 program. This academy also uses spreadsheets to keep student records and faces several difficulties in doing so, which include lack of security and long preparation time.

Teachers and registrars experience difficulties in using spreadsheet applications for keeping student records. These difficulties include the submission of grades, done through flash drive or via messenger application, and monitoring submission, no submission, late submission, and latest submissions (occurs when there are multiple submissions due to revisions). These records are also prone to data corruption. Moreover, securing such files is difficult since there is no way to know when and who edited the file without permission from certain authorities.

The academy also suffers long preparation time for each spreadsheet file since each file is edited by the IT head, changing the formula for grade computation of each cell using the excel syntax, according to grade level and subjects. The said preparation is repeated four times a year. Furthermore, merging individual grade sheets from different subjects, printing report cards and making summary reports are also a difficulty for the IT head since these grades and data come from different files. Lastly, keeping track of SHS students with failed subjects is difficult since each student has their own set of currently taking subjects. Students who failed in a subject in a semester is required to take the remedial class the next semester. An error or missed information may lead to an overflow of subjects to be taken next semester.

\subsection{Objectives of the Study}
The main goal of the study is to develop a web-based application for record keeping of students' grades with the following functionalities:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The application will have a \textbf{System Administrator} who will be able to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Login and logout
		\item Change administrator password
		\item View and update profile
		\item Create teachers' and other (Director and Registrar) user accounts
		\item Create student accounts
        \item Activate and deactivate an account 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Account deactivation will only happen if the owner of the account is no longer affiliated with the school or is suspended from work and other reasons for deactivation.
        \end{enumerate}
		\item View the edit/update log of the grade sheets
		\begin{enumerate}
            \item This is a read-only log. Its sole purpose is to keep track of all the changes happening in the grade sheets submitted.
        \end{enumerate}
		\item Update grade computation formula with permission from the director
		\begin{enumerate}
            \item Grade computation is subjected to change only when DepEd issues a change. No editing will happen without consent from the school director.
        \end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item The application will have a \textbf{Director}'s account. The director will be able to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Login and logout
		\item View and update profile
		\item Change his/her password
		\item Approve updates of grade computation formula
		\item View grades from each subjects
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item These grade sheets will also provide student information, name, student number, and section. The name of the handling the subject will also be included.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item View condensed grades of each section
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Condensed grades will not only show grades. It will also give information about the teachers assigned to each subject and the adviser of the section being viewed.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item View number of students who passed/failed
        \item View school information, Elementary Learners Data, Elementary Learners Age Profile, Junior High School Learners Data, JHS Learners Age Profile, Senior High School Repeaters Age Profile, SHS Learners Data by Track, SHS Learners Data in Technical-Vocational-Livelihood Track Specializations, Total Number of Enrollees, Number of Enrollees by Sex, Age, Grade Level, and etc., needed by DepEd and Private Educational Assistance Committee (PEAC)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{Registrar}'s account will be able to do the following functionalities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Login and logout
        \item View and update profile
        \item Change his/her password
        \item Set deadline for submission of grades
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Deadline for submission of grades will be set to be able to see who submitted late since a fine is to be collected for every day, after the due date, without submission. Deadline alerts will be automatically sent by the system, during 5 days and 3 days before the deadline and during the deadline day. Different deadline for teachers is possible especially if one teacher has more load compared to others.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item View previous student records
        \item View and produce Transcript of Records (TOR)
        \item View school information, Elementary Learners Data, Elementary Learners Age Profile, Junior High School Learners Data, JHS Learners Age Profile, Senior High School Repeaters Age Profile, SHS Learners Data by Track, SHS Learners Data in Technical-Vocational-Livelihood Track Specializations, Total Number of Enrollees, Number of Enrollees by Sex, Age, Grade Level, and etc., needed by DepEd and Private Educational Assistance Committee (PEAC).
        \item Update the names of sections
        \item Add students to a section
        \item View grade submission logs of teachers
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Teacher}'s accounts are divided into two, subject teachers and teachers who are also advisers, both will be able to: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Login and logout
        \item View and update profile
        \item Change his/her password
        \item Input and update grades in their respective class record
        \item View grades/class record
        \item Submit grades
    \end{enumerate}

    If the teacher is also an adviser, additional functionalities will be available:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item View condensed grades of the section he/she is handling
        \item View his/her advisee's report cards in pdf format
        
        A pdf file will be available once the condensed grades have been finalized.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Student} accounts can do the following activities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Login and logout
        \item View and update profile
        \item Change his/her password
        \item View class record from past grade levels to present

        \item View and update profile
        \item Change his/her password
        \item View student's grades from past grade levels to present
    \end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Significance of the Project}
Using spreadsheets have proven to be a useful tool for keeping student records but this is only useful for individual subjects. Difficulties in merging records or grades from different teachers and subjects arise. It also has security problems; the registrar can edit the file without consent.

The web-based application will lessen the time needed for grade submission and deliberation, and it will also provide security for files. Submission will not require flash drives and messenger application. Tracking late submissions of grades will also be easier and accurate since every submission will be recorded in the log. The application will also provide security for students' records since grades will not be easily edited and an edit log will also be available.

In addition, this application will also keep parents up to date with their child's performance and help SHS lessen their load for the next semester when a failed subject is needed.

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system will be created based on the process followed by Dee Hwa Liong Academy.
	\item The grading system is provided by the academy and follows the K-to-12 program grading system.
	\item The deliberation of grades will still be done personally by the registrar, subject teachers, advisers, and possibly, by the director and principal.
	\item Character traits of students will also be included in the system.
	\item The system will be created to solve bottle neck problems of the grade management system of Dee Hwa Liong Academy. These bottle neck problems include the preparation and distribution of grade sheets per subject teacher, produce a condensed grade sheet per grade level, and formatting of grades for printing.
	\item The system will be fully online, no offline counterpart, and accounts cannot be requested through the system. Accounts will be created by the system administrator.
	\item React.js and Express.js will be used for developing the web application therefore the server to be used, by the client, must support a node.js server environment.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Review of Related Literature}
 

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Assessment of Students}
Dee Hwa Liong Academy handles students from Nursery, Kinder1, Kinder2, and Grades 1 to 12.

\subsubsection{Nursery and Kinder1}
Nursery and Kinder1 use a progressive curriculum, and the basis for assessing a student is a checklist. Checklists are called Developmental Assessment Scale. This scale is divided into four development skills - Physical Development, Self-help Skills, Socio-emotional Development, and Pre-academic Development. Physical development is further divided into gross motor development and fine motor development. On the other hand, pre-academic development is divided into reading readiness, language development, computer literacy, number readiness, music, art and P.E. (MAPE), and Chinese. Each skill under these development skills are graded according to a scale. All traits are observed by the students' adviser. The legends for this checklist are excellent (E) - excellent knowledge, very good (VG) - notable knowledge, good (G) - satisfactory knowledge, average (A) - fair knowledge, present (P) - observed, and not observed (OB) - not yet observed. Grades of nursery and kinder1 pupils are combined and deliberated quarterly.

\subsubsection{Kinder2, Grades 1 to 10}
Kinder2 and Grades 1 to 10 use the K-to-12 curriculum. Teachers are given grade sheets to record a student's grade. The basis for assessments are written work, performance tasks, and exams. The grade sheet has columns for formative tasks. Formative tasks are used to check if students are ready for graded seatwork and activities. Usually, formative tasks are not part of a student's grade but are recorded in the grade sheet. Written work is divided into two, quizzes and others, while performance tasks comprise of oral participation, individual work, group work, individual project, group project and other output by students. In addition to these classroom activities, a quarterly exam is also used and recorded to check a student's performance. Similar to nursery and kinder1 students, grades are combined and delibarated quarterly.

\subsubsection{Grades 11 to 12}
Grade sheets for grades 11 to 12 are similar to kinder2 and grades 1 to 10. The only difference is instead of combining the grades quarterly, it is done per semester. Each semester, two exams are taken by students: midterm and final exam.

Character traits are also graded by teachers. 50\% of the character trait grades comes from the adviser while the remaining 50\% will come from the subject teachers. The character traits to be observed are \textit{makadiyos, makatao, makakalikasan,} and \textit{makabansa.} Character traits are graded with a scale: always observed (AO) - 100, sometimes observed (SO) - 90, rarely observed (RO) - 80, and not observed (NO) - 70.

Sometimes, attendance is included in a student's grade. Student's attendance and tardiness are recorded daily by teachers.

\subsection{Grade Submission}

Grades are submitted quarterly. Submission of grades is done through messenger or passing a flash drive to the registrar.

The registrar will also keep track of the submission date of the teachers. This is done manually by writing down the date the teacher submitted his/her grade sheet(s).

Character traits and attendance sheets will also be checked by the registrar.

\subsection{Deliberation of Grades}

Deliberation of grades will always be done personally with the subject teachers, adviser, and registrar. This is to ensure that all grades are correctly collected and final adjustments have been made before the creation of the condensed grades.

The registrar will talk and review the students' grades with the subject teacher. If no issues were raised during the talk, the registrar will accept the grade sheet to be added to the condensed grades according to the section. Adding students to the grade sheet will also be done during the discussion with the subject teacher.

The deliberation is also done for the condensed grade sheets. In this deliberation, the subject teachers, adviser, and registrar will sit down together to talk about a section's grade sheet. Grade adjustments and student's behaviors are also discussed during the deliberation.

\subsection{Printing of Report Cards}

Report cards are reviewed by each adviser to check if there are any errors in the input. Report cards include the grades for both academic and character traits. It will also include the student's attendance and tardiness record.

Report cards are created based on the condensed grade file. These cards are printed on a normal sheet of paper for the first three quarters. For the final quarter, it is printed on a card. These cards are distributed to parents quarterly.

\subsection{Node.js}

Node.js is an open source run-time environment. This was built in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine \cite{Shah}. It provides a long term efficiency through event-driven and non-blocking I/O model and server-size JavaScript \cite{Joyent}. Unlike apache web servers which uses PHP as a default language, this allows the creation of Web Applications and server connections using Javascript and a collection of external "modules" that manages various core functionality.  

\subsection{Express.js}

 Express.js covers the core Node.js \textit{http} module (http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) to provide extensive functionalities and features \cite{Mardan}. This framework consists of many plugin modules called \textit{middleware} \cite{Mardan}. Express acts as a foundation for a custom-built framework which fits the web application project.

\subsection{React.js}

React.js is a javascript library for building modern user interfaces \cite{Nahar}. It was created by Facebook and independent contributors and organizations. One of the key features of this library is the use of a "Virtual Document Object Model" or "Virtual DOM". It enables developers to build a whole web application as if the entire webpage is rendered on each individual page but only web components that actually change. It also uses Javascript XML (JSX), which is an extension to the Javascript syntax. Its syntax is similar to the Hypertext Markup Tool (HTML), which makes it similar to existing web developers.

\subsection{MySQL}

My Structured Query Language (MySQL) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), and has around 6 million installations worldwite. \cite{DBEngines}. This is available as free software and is under GNU General Public License (GPL) \cite{mySQL}.

Some of the advantages of MySQL includes portability, good security features, flexible table structure, can be integrated with various programming languages, and small RAM usage \cite{mySQL}.  

\section{Design and Implementation}

\subsection{Context Diagram}

The web application will have five access levels such as the system administrator, director, teachers, parents/guardians, and students. Teachers can be divided into teachers only and advisers. A context diagram is shown below in Figure 1.

\end{center}

\newpage
\subsection{Activity Diagrams}

All accounts will have a login and logout function. Each user account can also change the account's password. The password change is done within the system. No external links will be provided for password change. Profiles for each account will be available and can be updated.

The system administrator is the one managing the system.

The user can create accounts for the other users such as director, registrar, teachers, and students. All account creation will not have any creation requests.

The administrator is the only one with access to the activity logs of the condensed grade sheet. The activity log records every information changes that occur to grade sheets in the system. This activity log cannot be edited nor deleted, it is only readable. The administrator can also search the log using date, time, teacher's name, section, school year, grade level, and/or grade sheet name.

Activation and deactivation of accounts is also a functionality of the administrator. An account can be deactivated if the user is no long affiliated with the school.

Since DepEd may issue a change in the grading process of schools, updating grade computation formula is also included in the function of the administrator. Such changes can only occur if the school director approves these changes.

As mentioned earlier, some changes or updates can only occur if the director approves it.

The director is the one who directs and shapes the curriculum and the teaching process of a school.

This user will be the one in charge of approving changes for grade computation formula. Furthermore, he can also view grades of each subject and the condensed grades. Viewing of summary reports is also possible.

Summary reports will get all the information needed from the database of the system.

The school registrar is in charge of keeping student records.

The school registrar will be able to set the deadline for submission of grades. Different deadlines may be set for different teachers due to their workload differences. Deadline alerts will be automatically sent, by the system, during 5 days and 3 days before the deadline and during the deadline day.

Since a school registrar keeps student records, they can view record from past school years and produce TORs. Viewing of summary reports will also be possible. Summary reports may be requested by the principal, director, and/or the DepEd and PEAC.

School registrars can update the student list of each section by adding or removing students from the class list. They can also update the section name and view the submitted grade of teachers.

Another activity log will be present under this user, which is the submission logs of teachers. This will be used to check the teachers who failed to comply with the deadline set by the registrar.

A school will never be a school without its teachers. In this system, there are two types of teachers: teacher-only and teacher/advisers.

Both types can input and update the grades of students. Their grade sheets will be automatically be available after they input the class and subjects they are handling in their profiles.

Both teacher-only and advisers can also submit the grades through the application to create the condensed grades sheet. Before submitting the grades, the teacher must be sure that there are no errors with the record. A save function will be available to save changes made in the grade sheet.

The difference between teacher-only and teacher/adviser, teacher/adviser can view the condensed grades of their advisees from the profiles. In addition, teacher/adviser can view his/her advisees' report carrds after the condensed grades have been finalized.

Finally, the student, this user can only do simple things such as view grades from his/her past grade levels to present.

\subsection{Database Design}

\subsubsection{Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)}

Figure 1 shows the relationship among the user account, student, parent guardian, teacher, and nonacademic tables. The user account table contains the login credentials and basic information such as first name, last name, middle name, etc. of the user. System administrator, registrar, and principal/director fall under the nonacademic table.

Figure 2 shows the relationship among the grade sheet, category, grade, teacher, section, grade level, and subject. The grade sheet table contains the collection of grades of students in a section. The category table shows the type of activity being recorded in the grade sheet. The grade table contains an individual grade of the student, and other important information such as date, category, and entry number. The section table shows the section name of the class record. The subject table contains the subject code and the subject name of the grade sheet.

Figure 3 shows the relationship among the grade, student, category, and grade sheet. The grade table contains an individual grade of the student, and other important information such as date, category, and entry number. The category table shows the type of activity being recorded in the grade sheet. The grade sheet table contains the collection of grades of students in a section.

Figure 4 shows the relationship among the attendance log, teacher, and the student. The attendance log table contains the atendance information of a student in a specific day. The table also contains the studentID of the student and the teacher recording the attendance. 

Figure 5 shows the relationship among the advisory table, grade level, teacher and section. The advisory table contains the section being handled by the adviser. It also contains other information such as the grade level of the students being handled, the section, school year, and academic term. The teacher can only have an exact one advisory section. 

Figure 6 shows the relationship among the formula table, category, and grade level. The formula table shows the percentage of each component from each subject category per grade level. The category table shows the type of activity being recorded in the grade sheet. 

Figure 7 shows the relationship among the teacher load, subject, teacher, and section. The teacher load table shows the subject being handled by the teachers. Teachers can have multiple load since they can teach multiple sections throughout the academic year. They can also teach multiple subjects.

Figure 8 shows the relationship among submission deadline and teacher. The submission deadline tables contains the deadline date for the submission of grades of the teacher set by the registrar. Teacher can only have exactly one submission deadline.

\subsection{System Architecture}

Dee Hwa Liong Academy Web Application will be built under the Node.js server environment. Express.js will be used as a library for fetching data through API calls (using routers). The system will be using React.js library as the main front-end backbone. For the user interface, Ant Design, a design language made for React environment, alongside with Tabler React, an open-source UI framework for building dashboard applications will be used to make the website more responsive. MySQL will be used as the database of the system.

\subsection{Technical Architecture}

The students' grade management system will be accessed online. It follows a client-server-database architecture. The main server should have the following specifications (minimum requirements):
