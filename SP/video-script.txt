Section 1: Quick Overview of Chapter 
// part 1
Good day everyone, I will be presenting my topic, which is Dee Hwa Liong Academy Grade Management System. Before we start, I would like to present a short summary of my chapter one. 

The Philippines recently implemented the K-to-12 program on its basic education. It comes with context-based, and spiral prograssion learning curriculum, as well as different career tracks for senior highschool students. To name a few, we have Academic, Sports and Arts, and Technical-Vocational-Livelihood. 

The Department of Education provided teachers a copy of Electronic Class Record templates, which is known as ECR. These templates provide grade computation consistent with the Policy Guidelines on Classroom Assessment for the K to 12 Basic Education Program. 

ECR templates are microsoft excel based. It has (3) components for grades: Written works, Performance tasks, and quarterly assessment. the templates differ at least each grade level. The ECR also changes when senior highschool students are being handled. these changes include following a different set of weights for each component compared to grades 1 to 10.

Since Dee Hwa Liong Academy implements the K-to-12 program, it faces several difficulties  which include tedious process for creating multiple ECR for each teacher, long preparationg time, and lack of security

At the start of the school year the IT head gets all enrolled students, their corresponding section, and the subject load of each teacher from the registrar's office. the IT head then manually generates ECR files from these data, adding the teacher's current load with corresponding students enrolled in that subject. So, if there are 50 teachers and on average, each teacher teaches 5 subject, the IT head has to manually create 250 spreadsheets to distribute to teachers.

the files by default, are not secured. It is also prone to data corruption. submitting class records to the registrar would require the use of flash drives or even sending the files over facebook messenger. in result, the files can easily be duplicated, and keeping track of the most updated file is difficult. and files can also be accessed by anyone, thus allowing unauthorized person to modify the grades. and also, if anyone changes the file, there is no way to track what part of the class record was modified and who made the changes.

The It head also has to generate the condensed grades of each student, from different spreadsheet files. this involves linking multiple ECR files to a single spreadsheet. generating report cards for students is also a tedious process. they have to manually generate report cards for all enrolled students and scan through all ECR files to get their corresponding grades.

The main goal of thie topic is to develop a web-based application for record keeping of students grades with the following functionalities

the application will have a system administator who will be able to
-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-create user accounts
-assign parents to student accounts
and
delete and account - account deletion will only happen if the owner is no longer affiliated with the school

the application will have a director's account. the director will be able to
-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-view grades from all subjects
-view list and number of students who passed/failed
and
-view list and number of honor students

A regustrar's account will be able to do the following functionalities:

-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-create a school year and update the current quarter
-add/update the names of sections
-enroll students to a section
-set deadline for submission of grades
-view and modify grades under deliberation process
-post grades
-view student records from past school years to present
and
-view and produce report cards

A Cashier's account will be able to do the following functionalities:
-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-view all students
-restrict a student account - holding a student acccount will only happen if the student has unpaid balance

Teacher's account will be able to do the following functionalities
-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-input and update class records
-view class records
-submit grades for deliberation process
if the teacher is also an adiviser, additional functionalities will be available:
-view condensed grades of the section he/she is handling
-view his/her advisee's report cards in pdf format

student account will be able to do the following functionalities:
-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-view report cards from past school years to present

parent/guardian account will be able to do the following functionalities
-login and logout
-change password
-view and update profile
-view student's report cards from past school years to present






Section 2: Video Demo

Dee Hwa Liong Academy grade Management system is divided into 6 modules: system administrator, director, registrar, cashier, teacher, student, and parent.

All user accounts will be directed to the login page. At the start, only the system administrator has the access to the system. the system admin will handle all creation of accounts.

All users can edit their personal information using the system. They can also change password.

Jumping to system administrator module, we have the dashboard page. Accounts are create manually, indicating the email, position, first name, middle name, and last name. All user accounts will also be listed in the dashbaord. a user account can be deleted if the owner is no longer affiliated with the school or suspended. 

There is also a assigning a parent feature in the system. assigning a parent to student will give the parent access to the student records.

For the director's module.
